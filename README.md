# NightSkyGuide
Initial concept code for Astronomy Field Guide

Astronomy Field Guide

Concept is to have an app that assists amateur astronomers,
typically using a Dobsonian telescope, to find objects manually
in the night sky and serve as an observing log.

Initial version - for use during Messier Marathon

•	Include list of all 110 Messier objects including info

•	App calculates current Alt and Az.

•	Allows user to filter list based on magnitude (ease of observing)

• Calculate Rise/Set Time for each object to prioritize viewing

•	Displays filtered list sorted by Set Time and/or constellation

•	Once object observed, record key observing details

•	Provide constellation images to aid beginning amateur astronomers

•	List pages to S&T's Pocket Sky Atlas and Birren's Objects In The Heavens


App should facilitate observing and not conflict with the Observing 
Program Rules of the Astronomical League, such as:

>Since the purpose of the Messier Program is to familiarize the 
>observer with the nature and location of the objects in the sky, 
>the use of an automated telescope which finds the objects without
>effort on the part of the observer is not acceptable. "Automated
>telescope" also includes the use of digital setting circles where
>a read-out shows the user directions to follow to find an object.
>This also includes the unacceptable use of smartphones that use 
>apps to locate objects in the night sky. The use of the setting 
>circles found on the axis of telescope should also be avoided.
>In short, only finderscopes, Telrads, or Telrad-like devices are 
>acceptable.
>
>The purpose of the "no GOTO" rule is so that you learn the sky
>and learn how associate a map with the real sky. Learn how to
>get from here to there without the electronics or the scales.
>Learn to locate objects without the electronic interface. The 
>knowledge of being able to perform this will always be a benefit
>in the future.

Update: Scott Kranz, the Messier Program Coordinator for the
Astronomical League confirmed that this app does not conflict
with the Messier Program rules.
